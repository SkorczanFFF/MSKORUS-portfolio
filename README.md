# MSKORUS.PL - MY PORTFOLIO WEBPAGE

My official portfolio website showing my projects and skills. At this point site is only avaliable in Polish language.
Project equipped with two separate scenes of WebGL home section - what you see is determined of your screen width.

### HOW IT'S MADE?

Mainly this site is based on:

- React
- React Three Fiber
- SASS
- HTML
- models exported from Blender

But also I used some React packages like:

- react-icons
- react reveal
- emailjs
- gltfjsx
- and more like @drei and postprocessing for WebGL scene

### STORY BEHIND THIS

In the last year of studying I was introduced to Three.js. As a React fan I decided to combine these two technologies into one page.

### IDEAS TO DO

- add interactivity to WebGL scene like scale on hover and color change on clik

### UPDATE

- fixed portfolio gallery bug on Chrome and Opera
- and some minor changes
